# PAN-GIT-DEMO

This is a sample project to demonstrate how git works. This is for the Trainocate PAN class session.

## Basics of git

### Clone a repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ralampay/pan-git-demo.git [folder-name]
```

### Make changes to a repository

Do anything inside the project

### Check current changes in local repository

```
git status
```

### Track the current changes done in the project

```
git add --all
```

### Commit to our LOCAL repository

```
git commit -m "commit message that is descriptive but concise"
```

### Push changes to a REMOTE repository

```
git push origin master
```

### Pull changes from a REMOTE repository

```
git pull origin master
```

#### For conflict resolution (merging)

1. Check the files as identified as CONFLICT
2. (optional) Create an issue
3. Resolve the changes by editting the files
4. Commit changes to remote repository (including Resolves #issueNo in commit message optionally close an issue)
5. Push to remote
